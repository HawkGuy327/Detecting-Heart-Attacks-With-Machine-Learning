# Detecting-Heart-Attacks-With-Machine-Learning

Created a KNN model to predict a user's chances of heart attack based on age, gender, cholesterol levels and maximum heart rate under mentorship of David Chung for CS1 Final Project 

This research was conducted to determine whether or not medical issues can be easily detected or prevented by machines with relatively small amounts of data. In this case, research was conducted using machine learning and a set of vitals at a point in time. After training, the vitals were able to be fed into the algorithm, producing accurate results almost 80% of the time. This was simply a preliminary test, so it was not perfect, but with further training over an extended period of time, results could easily be improved to a point of near perfection.
